ip portal
	switch ips are constant and setup by white
	one ip per team is initially allocated to setup one machine
	then each team can request ips via the ip portal
	can request 1 to 256 ips
	everyone is in the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet
	packets with ips not assigned are dropped and points taken away from team
	no team subnets means that teams have no idea where IPs are coming from (and so they really can't setup a firewall)

attacks
	visualization will "pulse" all nodes in an attack
	pulses may be a change in the node's opacity with a change in its border color (and may even include some sort of halo around it)
	some will randomly animate to the center and circle each other while pulsing
	no attack/attacker icon since it is conceivable that two associated nodes are attacking each other
	assume any inter-team traffic is attack unless it's from/to white
	use tcpdump to grab traffic and src/dest IPs/MACs (use -e option in tcpdump)
	disable all existing attacks in db
	add new attacks in db (as enabled)
	sa (situational awareness) portal first pulls alls enabled attacks
	then it removes all animated nodes in the center (animates them back to their teams)
	then it "unpulses" all the nodes no longer involved in an attack
	then it "pulses" all nodes in an attack
	finally some are randomly selected to animate to the center (same behavior as before)

nodes
	simply poll each switch to see the connected MACs
	since each switch is known and is associated with a team, we can map MACs to teams
	record discover time and timeout time
	nodes portal first pulls all nodes without a timeout time and their associated team
	then it removes all existing nodes not in the list
	finally it adds new nodes in the list
